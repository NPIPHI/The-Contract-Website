            "The Contract" is a role-playing game that utilizes a round-robin storytelling format
            where individual sessions tell a self-contained story, and the position of storyteller is
            rotated between the various members of the group. Because of this, each game will have a slightly
            different cast of characters, or "High Rollers", which helps to solve the age-old roleplaying
            problem of absenteeism.
            <br><br>
            Groups of players are encouraged to develop their own setting and character concepts. There are
            no preset classes or paradigms in The Contract, yet characters remain balanced and portable thanks
            to a robust{% endblocktrans %} <a href="">Powers system.</a>

            allowing you to be anything from a ninja in feudal japan to a cyborg in the year 2200. All the while
            character portability is maintained so that you can visit other groups of players without balance concerns.
